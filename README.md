# Social Media Helper
Ever wanted to tag people in LinkedIn on Twitter but couldn't remember who is the right one to tag?
This tool helps you organize your contacts. You can add people by their LinkedIn or Twitter-handle and attach a tag to them.
When you are about to publish a new post, let's say about PeopleAnalytics, you just pick your tag+plattform and how many of your contacts you want. The tool randomly picks those contacts matching your tag and gives you the result in a text-box for you to copy&paste it.

## LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a little bit special. You can't just paste a handle like @pboesenberg there and post it. In LinkedIn you have to select each contact manually in a dropdown. Pretty annoying. 
### Idea for future versions
When you post in LinkedIn, yo can see in Chrome Developer tools, that LinkedIn is posting tagged people with @somebody along with some metadata. Maybe this could be an approach to automate tagging of people.

# Technologies
I used R, R Shiny and MongoDB in this app.
